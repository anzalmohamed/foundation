<h3> ALTERNATIVE PREVENTIVE HEALTH CARE -ARK HEALTHY FOODS & PREVENTIVE MEDICINE (AHFPM)</h3>

<p>Many illnesses have their roots in our spiritual wellbeing. A spiritual illness affects us physically, but to cure it, we may need to work on our spiritual health.

From a spiritual point of view, illness comes from an imbalance in our lives. It can often be a result of unhealthy beliefs we have picked up about the world, ourselves and other people. However, for true healing to occur, we cannot simply suppress the symptoms of illness with medication. Instead, we must look at the root cause of our spiritual illness.

We should, of course, seek medical attention for any illness that threatens our immediate health. However, many illnesses are spiritual in nature and can only be solved by deep emotional and spiritual work.

</p>
<p>Spiritual illness can seem scary and difficult to overcome. However, it also offers a powerful message of hope. We have the power to overcome what ails us. We can make a difference in our lives. By taking steps to understand and accept ourselves we can heal our soul and spirit and come back to wholeness and health.
